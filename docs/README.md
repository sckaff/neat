# Documentation

Short answer: Incomplete

plan.md: The way I want to build this, scattered notes I will arrange
resources.md: Some resources I come back to when I want to iterate through some ideas

## QA

1. TWO APPROACHES: From environment simulations, or pre-built genetics. How to merge both?
  
    Both.

2. Agent needs periodic 'trials and tribulations.' What would the nature of these trials be? Creative? Cyclic? Monte-Carlo like (RL trials)?
  
    It will be emergent through competition with other agents. Maybe not useful at the beginning, as the environment must be populated first, then competed against (as agents become increasingly different in neural gene).
